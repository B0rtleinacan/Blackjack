# Blackjack
This a terminal game of Blackjack made in Python.

The game will print out a question from the "Dealer" saying something along the lines of "Hit or Stay", the Player will be able to choose 'Hit' or 'Stay' from whatever card sum they are at and it will add it to the total the Player has. 

If the total amount is over 21 when the Player selects 'Hit', the game will end and will count as a 'Bust'.
